If you are an entrepreneur and your startup has been operating for a while now with the first customers coming in, you might be start wondering how well your company is doing. That is when you start looking for the numbers or metrics that help describe the current and somehow predict the future financial state of the company.

Just like how human body measurements such as height, weight, or oxygen level matters to anybody as they show how the body is functioning, startups should closely monitor the metrics that measure their progress. 

But which growth metrics actually matter for startups? If you look up guides on the internet, there are a swarm of metric acronyms such as CTR, CVR, CPM, IPM, CPA, LTV, etc. With its limited time and resource, a startup should stay focused and choose to follow the KPIs that are the most relevant to them. 

That why startups need a framework to help them choose the relevant metrics for their business model. One of the most widely used framework is called the **Pirate Funnel** or **AAARRR framework**.

**AAARRR Pirate Metrics** framework is an acronym for a set of five user-behavior metrics that product-led growth businesses should be tracking: acquisition, activation, retention, referral, and revenue.

1. **Awareness** – How many people do you reach?
1. **Acquisition**– How many people visit your website?
1. **Activation**– How many people are taking the first step?  (For example, sign up, download an app, or submit their first comment.)
1. **Retention** – How many people come back for a second/third/tenth time?
1. **Revenue**– How many people start paying? And how much do they pay?
1. **Referral** – How many people recommend your company to their friends?

Let's break down each of the steps in the Pirate Funnel.

## Awareness

Awareness is the first stage that your customers discover you and know that you exist. It refers to all the channels you use to introduce people to your product including social media, SEO, marketing and advertising campaigns.

In this phase, founders should ask themselves these questions:

* What are the advertising channels that will lead directly to the product’s target audience?
* What platforms do your users engage with the most?
* What channels can you use to spread word-of-mouth virality?

Example of metrics to measure in the awareness phase:

* Impressions
* Landing page bounce rates
* Site visits

## Acquisition

Activation refers to users taking the desired actions, or next steps, after their first encounter with your company’s product, website, or content. Examples of user acquisition actions include: signing up for the free trial, signing up for newsletter, visiting more pages, discovering more features of your product.

During this phase, you acquire more simple details about your customers such as names, emails, genders and geographical locations, etc. These information help startup have some basic understanding of their potential customers, a.k.a "personas"

Questions to answer in the acquisition phase:

* What keeps your customers up at night?
* What drives your customers to find solutions to their problems? 
* What is the cost-per-acquisition (CPC) for each marketing channel?
* Is this marketing channel bringing you the right customers?

Metrics to measure in the acquisition phase:

* Customer acquisition cost (CAC)
* Conversion rate
* Traffic driven to the website (per channel)
* Click-through rate
* Cost per click
* Bounce rates

## Activation

The goal of the activation phase is to provide an outstanding customer experience, in other words, creating a "AHA" moment for your customers.  

During activation phase, the company goes deeper into understanding their customers, how they interact with your onboarding process, how they start using the main features of the product, etc.

This is when you should combine getting user feedback and data analysis to get the big picture of your target customer groups.

Questions to answer in the activation phase:

* What can you do to give your customers an unforgettable experience?
* What do customers value most about your service?
* What steps should an ideal customer take?

Metrics to measure in the activation phase:

* How many customers used a key product feature? 
* Visitors to registration ratio 
* Conversion rate
* Dwell time + viewed pages 
* Drop-off rate

## Retention

Getting new customers are great but how to keep them staying and continuing using your product or service is more challenging. The general rule is that the cost of acquiring new customers is usually much higher than retaining already existing customers. Thus this Retention phase is one of the most important part in the Pirate Funnel framework. 

During this phase, your startup should closely monitor and analyse your customers' behaviors. The ultimate goal is to maintain a high rate of retention. 

Questions to answer in the retention phase:

* How long are customers using your service?
* What does customer retention mean for your service?
* What is most valuable to your customers?

Metrics to measure in the retention phase:

* Retention rate vs. churn rate
* Click through rate of emails
* Customer churn
* Average customer retention length (time people stay active customers)
* Net Promoter Score

## Referral

If an existing customer refers your service to their friends and acquaintances, that is absolutely a good sign showing that your business has found the right market. As the referral is usually word-of-mouth, the cost of marketing and customer acquisition is virtually zero.

Therefore customer referral is something that startup should follow up closely.

Questions to answer in the referral phase:

* What would be the best incentives for consumers to invite their friends?
* Which aspects of my service do customers appreciate the most?
* When are consumers most likely to invite friends to join them on their journey?

Metrics to measure in the referral phase:

* Percentage of customers who refer friends to your product
* Referred customers
* Percentage of total purchases by referred customers
* Lifetime value of referred customers
* Positive reviews
* Social media shares
* Sent invitations & successful invitations
* Net Promoter Score

## Revenue

The final Pirate Metric int eh AAARRR funnel framework is revenue. One of the most common metric to measure the revenue brought by potential customers is **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)**. It estimates a customer's total revenue over the course of their lifetime.

The formula for Customer Lifetime Value can be complicated depends on how many different products and services you are offering. But the simplist formula to calculate CLV is:

Customer Lifetime Value = Average revenue per customer/ churn rate

Usually startups would compare the average customer lifetime value to customer acquisition cost (CLV vs CAC) to see whether they would make a profit from acquiring more customers. A rule of thumbs for a good ratio is **CLV:CAC = 3:1**

Questions to answer in the revenue phase:

* What percentage of the customers convert to paying customers?
* What is the average order value per customer?
* How many repeat customers do I have, and how often do they make purchases?

Metrics to measure in the revenue phase:
* Customer lifetime value (CLV)
* Customer acquisition cost (CAC)
* Monthly recurring revenue (MRR)
* How many free customers become paying customers?
* Average order value per customer
* Repeated purchases

## Conclusion

The AAARRR framework is the simplest and most effective way to optimize your business and measure growth. It can be applied to any startup with different business models. 

To correctly measure these metrics that you have chosen for your company, you would need the most basic and solid data & analytics setup.
