Whether you are a sole entrepreneur or involved in a startup with a presence on the internet, data analytics helps you get the necessary insights to make prompt decisions and improve your business.

However, startup founders are typically not familiar with analytics tools, even if they have some ideas about the metrics that they want to follow, they do not know where to start. Besides the cost of setting up analytics tools is another concern for many founders who do not consider data analytics a priority until their startup reaches a later stage, but that is when they missed out a lot of important information about their product and users.

This is a guide to some of the most popular data analytics tools that you can start using for your company. Most of these products are free, or they do offer free packages for startups, but they are powerful enough during the first phase of your data & analytics journey. Depends on the growth stage of your company, you can then decide when to subscribe for more features or hire professional data analyst to implement data analytics projects for you.

## [Google Analytics 4](https://analytics.google.com/)

First on the list is Google Analytics 4 (**GA4**), which is a platform that collects data from your websites and mobile apps to create reports that provide insights into your business.

Setting up GA4 is fairly easy. To measure a website, you just need to add a small piece of JavaScript code to each page on your website. Every time a user visits a web page, the tracking code will collect anonymous information about how that user interacted with the page. 

Google Analytics will help you understand number of users, their characteristics, and where they come from. You can also measure what actions users are taking on your app or website and customize reports specific to your business, among many other things.

The older and current version of Google Analytics is called Universal Analytics (**UA**). The main difference between GA4 and UA is that in older version, the data model is based on sessions and page views while GA4 is moving towards events and parameters.

Note that from July 1, 2023, onwards, Universal Analytics will stop functioning and be replaced totally by GA4. Therefore, we recommend that you should get started right away with implementing Google Analytics 4 in your website or mobile app.

![Segment](../../blog/post1/segment.png)

## [Segment](https://segment.com)

Segment is a platform to collect, transform, send and archive your user data. It works on websites, mobile apps and even back-end processes that run on a server or OTT device. 

The concept of Segment is similar to Google Tag Manager, however, Segment helps simplify the process of collecting data and send the data to hundreds of different **marketing, product and analytics tools** as well as to **data warehouse**. 

Therefore, Segment is not essentially a data analysis tool but its role is an one-stop shop to collect users' behavioral data and significantly reduce the time integrating new tools. You just need to come up with the tracking plan, then work with your developers to do the implementation once, then later on you can integrate new tools without touching the codes.

Segment is very popular with many startups as a data foundation to find their Product-Market fit with data and accelerate their growth. Even though the subscription price is very steep, Segment has a [Twilio Segment Startup Program](https://segment.com/industry/startups/?utm_campaign=gg_emea_dg-demo_search_brand_acquisition&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_content=segment_startup&utm_term=segment%20startup&gclid=CjwKCAjwsfuYBhAZEiwA5a6CDCXVv58TAB9l268unAP_gxCYPfzZ_aGeeyF2ZlwIp8S_QK0pVVEbXhoCJgYQAvD_BwE) in which they grant early-stage startups up to two years of free access, so it is very worth trying their product.

## [Amplitude](https://amplitude.com)

Amplitude is a self-service product analytics tools that help business users such as Product, Growth, and Marketing team understand better their customer journey and make informed decisions about product design and the customer journey using event-based analytics.

What is event-based analytics and how is it different from the conventional customer-based analytics? 

Event-based analytics is defined as the method of tracking and analyzing interactions between users and your product, also known as events. An event is any action or behavior that occurs within a digital touchpoint, such as a mobile app, email, product dashboard, CRM, or web page.

Tracking user behaviors and events goes beyond simple metrics, such as page views or traffic channels. Examples of event-based analytics with Amplitude include **Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis** and **Segmentation**.

Sounds like a very powerful tool to have, it must be expensive? Luckily Amplitude has a **Starter Pack**, which generously gives your startup 10M events per month and unlimited data sources as well as users. 

You can implement Segment which we introduced above and simply send Segment data to Amplitude, and your teams will have a powerful product analytics tool at hand.

## [Mixpanel](https://mixpanel.com)

Mixpanel, essentially a direct competitor to Amplitude, is another choice for your product analytics.

They provide similar functionalities as Ampplitude to help you get quick insights into your product and users. Users can easily create interactive reports such as **Flow Reports, Conversion Analysis**, and **A/B Testing analysis**. Many consider Mixpanel to have a slightly better UI/UX than Amplitude, which make data analysis a bit more fun and intuitive.

And to compete with Amplitude, Mixpanel also has a very generous [Mixpanel Startup Program](https://mixpanel.com/startups-apply/) where eligible startups get $50,000 in credits towards the Mixpanel Growth plan for one year. This plan also includes tracking up to 430 million events per month for free. 

So this is another free tool that we would recommend startups take advantage of and kick start their data & analytics journey.
